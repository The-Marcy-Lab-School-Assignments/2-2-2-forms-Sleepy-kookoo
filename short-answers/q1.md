# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
    When you click the submit button on the form, the browser sends the values that the user entered to your website's back end and this makes the page reload. To keep it from changing and reloading, we would use event.PreventDefault()

Not quite! Here is a [blog](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-we-use-eventpreventdefault-reason-behind-front-end-developer) that can explain this behavior!
