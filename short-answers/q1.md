# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
    When you click the submit button on the form, the website sends your email and password like a secret message in the website's address. This makes the page reload. To keep it from changing and reloading, we can send the message without changing the address.
